# Zumo Demo

This repository contains the interactive proof-of-concept for **Zumo**.

Zumo is a platform for deploying and orchestrating AI employees that operate like real teammates — monitoring systems, collaborating, and executing workflows securely.

This repo is a **high-fidelity simulation** designed for demos and investor presentations.

## What this demonstrates

- Creating AI employees in minutes
- Multi-agent collaboration workflows
- Runtime engine selection (OpenClaw, AutoGPT-style, etc.)
- Model provider flexibility
- Security policies and approvals
- Isolated execution environments (simulated)
- Audit logging and governance
- 24/7 monitoring simulation (Slack, Sentry, CRM)

## Important

This repository intentionally uses simulated infrastructure.

No real external APIs or agent runtimes are connected.

The goal is to demonstrate product vision and UX.
